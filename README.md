Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were undertaken to find the equilibrium molecular
structures and aid the assignment of the Raman modes of the isolated imidacloprid and clothianidin
molecules. The hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3-LYP, using Becke’s three parameter
exchange and Lee–Yang–Parr correlation was used along with a triple-ζ valence basis set which has
two sets of polarization functions, TVZPP. These are implemented in the Turbomole 6.4 code.39 The
dispersion forces were corrected by the Grimme’s DFT-D3 method. Redundant internal coordinates
were used for the geometry optimization with energy and gradient convergence criteria of less than
10–6 Hartree and 0.002 Hartree/Bohr. Force constant calculations were implemented to estimate
the vibrational modes of the isolated imidacloprid and clothianidin molecules and harmonic
vibrational frequencies were estimated by the analytical evaluation of second derivatives of the
energy. A scaling factor of 0.9669 was applied to the fundamental vibrational frequencies to
correct for the error due to the harmonic approximation in the theoretical model.
